This is a repository for metadata of BlueOS Extensions.

- [Available Extensions](https://docs.bluerobotics.com/BlueOS-Extensions-Repository)

For publishing a new extension, open a pull request to this repository with the following structure:

## Data in dockerhub

Additionally, we have versioned data. This data should be in each of your dockerhub tags, and use the following format:

```Dockerfile
LABEL version="1.0.0"
LABEL permissions='{\
  "ExposedPorts": {\
    "80/tcp": {}\          // we have a server at port 80
  },\
  "HostConfig": {\
    "PortBindings": {\
      "80/tcp": [\         // our server at port 80 is automatically bound to a free port in the host
        {\
          "HostPort": ""\
        }\
      ]\
    }\
  }\
}'
LABEL authors='[\
    {\
        "name": "John Doe",\
        "email": "doe@john.com"\
    }\
]'
LABEL company='{\
  "about": "brief description",\
  "name": "Company/Person Name",\
  "email": "email@company.com"\
}'
LABEL readme="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/{tag}/README.md"
LABEL links='{\
  "website": "https://...",\
  "support": "mailto:support@company.com",\
  "documentation": "https://docs.company.com/cool-extension/",\
}'
LABEL type="example"
LABEL tags='[\
  "positioning",\
  "navigation"\
]'
```

 - `version` is the name of the current tag, which we expect to be a valid [semver](https://semver.org/).
 - `permissions`is a json file that follows the [Docker API payload for creating containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/#tag/Container/operation/ContainerCreate).
 - `authors` is a json list of authors of your extension
 - `company` is a json with information about the maintainer responsible for providing new versions
 - `readme` is a URL to a markdown-based README file for the extension
 - `links` is a collection of additional useful/relevant links
 - `type` is a primary categorisation of the extension, and should be one of:
    - "device-integration"
    - "example"
    - "theme"
    - "other"
- `tags` is a collection of relevant tags for filtering, which should be lowercase alpha-numeric with dashes
    - limit of 10 per extension

Some additional information and examples are available in the 
[metadata documentation](https://docs.bluerobotics.com/ardusub-zola/software/onboard/BlueOS-latest/extensions#metadata-dockerfile).

 ## How this repo works

 Every time this repo changes, a Github Action runs and goes through all the .json files in here. For each of them, it reaches out to dockerhub and fetches all the available tags, extracting the metadata in LABELS and crafting a complete `manifest.json`, which is stored in this repo's `gh-pages` branch.

There is also a [website](https://docs.bluerobotics.com/BlueOS-Extensions-Repository) that gets generated, to show which extensions are currently available in the store.

## Testing the website locally

```bash
# clone and enter the repo
git clone ...
cd BlueOS-Extensions-Repository
# install yarn if necessary (`brew install yarn` on mac)
sudo apt install -y yarn
# install Python dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade poetry
python -m poetry install
# generate the manifest (takes some time)
python -m poetry run blueos_repository/consolidate.py
# make the manifest accessible to the local website
mv manifest.json website/public/
# install website dependencies
cd website
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
# generate and serve the website locally, in development mode
yarn dev
... # go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser (may need to refresh if it's not working)
```
